## Synopsis

Chords by Keyboard is a project modeled after the website, Patatap.  It is way to play chords by pressing a single keyboard input.  It contains a chord for every letter on the keyboard. The chords used vary between Major, Minor, 7 and Maj 7th. With this, anyone one can play a song with just a couple presses of the keyboard.  There is also a Help link that gives sample songs to play and popular chord progressions. I used Paper.js, an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTMl5 Canvas. This creates the animations that continuously loop through when the page is loaded. I also use Howler.js which makes working with audio in Javascript easy and reliable across all platforms. These frameworks and libraries made it possible to create such a fun and interesting application. 


## Motivation

I mixed my interest in music production and coding to produce this web based application.  It is based on Javascript and was inspired by a similar project from the Udemy course, The Web Developer Bootcamp. 

## Installation
Paper.js was included as local file and link in my HTML. Howler.js was linked as a CDN.
Please refer to Paper.js and Howler.js websites for proper use of these plugins.
